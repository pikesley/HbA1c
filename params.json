{"name":"Hba1c","tagline":"Because everybody's pancreas wants a RESTful API","body":"# HbA1c\r\n\r\n## Just because my pancreas is broken, doesn't mean it can't have a RESTful API\r\n\r\nI collect blood-glucose and medication data with [this](http://www.medivo.com/ontrack/). It can export XML and push it straight into Dropbox. Let's make an API! Let's make a dashboard! _Let's have badges!_\r\n\r\nRight now it's just a (shittily-named, now I think about it) Rake task:\r\n\r\n    rake export:jsonify\r\n    \r\nwhich grabs the newest file from a Dropbox folder called _ontrack/_ (configurable in _config/dropbox.yaml_), and parses it into some nice JSON, which I'm intending to poke into [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).\r\n\r\n## Setting it up\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/pikesley/HbA1c\r\n    cd HbA1c\r\n    bundle\r\n   \r\n(expects Ruby 2.1.0)\r\n\r\nYou need a Dropbox API key and secret from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps), then the [dropbox-api](https://github.com/futuresimple/dropbox-api) gem comes with a splendid Rake task\r\n\r\n    rake dropbox:authorize\r\n\r\nto do the Oauth manoeuvres and get the token and secret for you. Put these in _.env_ (see _.env.example_) and you should be good to go.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nHow hard can it be to wrap a RESTful API around MongoDB using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)? It's already JSON, right?\r\n\r\nAnd from there, it's a short hop to a beautiful [Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/) dashboard, I expect.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
